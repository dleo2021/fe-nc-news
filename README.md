# NC News

Welcome to my front-end project: NC News!

NC news has been designed as a dynamic single-page React application.
It is developed as a C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app providing users with an engaging experience for browsing and interacting with news articles.

## Deployed application:

Visit the React app here: https://nc-news-danleonard.netlify.app/

## Features:

- Browse articles: View all articles at a glance and view further details by selecting an individual article.
- Browse by topic: Filter by topic to view articles that interest the user most.
- Sort and order: View articles by selecting a sort query (title, author, date, etc.) in either ascending or descending order.
- Vote on articles: Users have the option to upvote or downvote articles.
- Users: Login in as an existing user to access further functionality on the app.
- Comment on articles: When logged in, users can leave comments on articles to express their thoughts.
- Delete comments: Logged in users are able to delete comments they have made on articles.
- Post articles: When logged in, users can post their own articles for others to interact with.

## Technologies used:

- React for building the user interface.
- Axios for promise-based HTTP requests.
- MUI Materials for enhanced styling options.
- React Router for client-side routing.
- Vite as the front-end build tool.
- Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Backend repository:

This front end application is designed to work with a dedicated back-end server, which provides the API endpoints for the React app.
